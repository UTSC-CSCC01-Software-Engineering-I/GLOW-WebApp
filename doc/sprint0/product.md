# GLOW – Great Lakes Observations of Water Temperatures

## Product Overview

GLOW is a mobile-optimized web application designed to crowdsource, visualize, and analyze nearshore water temperature data across the Great Lakes region. It empowers users such as swimmers, fishers, and boaters to monitor temperature trends, understand seasonal and daily variability, and contribute to long-term environmental data collection efforts.

While tools like [Swim Guide](https://www.theswimguide.org/) and [Water Rangers](https://app.waterrangers.ca/map) provide water quality maps, they lack intuitive context for temporal variation or long-term trends. GLOW fills this gap by combining crowdsourced temperature observations with historical datasets and visual storytelling, enabling informed decisions for recreation and research.

## Target Users

GLOW is primarily aimed at:

- **Casual users** (e.g., swimmers, beachgoers): to decide whether water is safe or pleasant for use.
- **Outdoor enthusiasts** (e.g., kayakers, anglers, fisher): who want to track water behavior for activity planning.
- **Citizen scientists** and **environmental researchers**: looking to contribute to or study temperature variability and climate trends.

## Feature Prioritization

Features are categorized based on importance, feasibility, and user research insights.

### Priority 1 – Must Have

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Mobile-responsive web app | Easy-to-use interface optimized for smartphones. |
| Upload geolocated water temperature | Allow users to submit temperatures, location, and date. |
| Map-based data visualization | Color-coded temperature icons (blue-green-yellow-orange-red). |
| Account creation and login | Track individual contributions and data history. |
| Archive and download data | Export historical data by date and location. |
| Unit toggling | Display temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. |
| Time range filters | View data by week, month, or year-to-date. |
| Comparison window | Show current readings vs historical monthly averages. |

### Priority 2 – Should Have

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Regional trend analysis | Display mean trends for a selected beach or geographic region. |
| Bulk data upload | Import datasets from city or government sources (e.g. [Toronto Beaches](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/toronto-beaches-observations/)). |
| User database export | Admin-only feature to download usernames and emails for updates. |

### Priority 3 – Nice to Have

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Gamification | Show user contributions with badges or rankings to encourage participation. |
| Educational section | Provide explanations of phenomena like upwelling, thermoclines, and seasonal cycles. |
| Satellite or buoy integration | Add real-time feeds from buoys or satellite datasets where available. |

## Market Sizing & Opportunity

Every year, millions of people visit the Great Lakes region for recreation, particularly during the summer. However, upwelling events driven by wind patterns can cause sudden drops in water temperature, a fact unknown to many users. GLOW not only informs but engages citizens in climate monitoring, filling a data and awareness gap.

A 2020 report estimates over **12 million recreational users** visit Ontario's waterfront annually. If even 0.1% of users contributed weekly data, GLOW would receive thousands of data points per month.

## Insights from Research

- **Pain Point**: Existing tools lack easy ways to compare present vs historical data.
- **Need for Context**: Users want to know why temperatures vary and what to expect.
- **Data Empowerment**: Citizen-contributed data builds local ownership and engagement in environmental change.

## Conclusion

GLOW blends crowdsourced environmental monitoring with a simple and engaging interface. By contextualizing user-submitted data and integrating existing datasets, GLOW empowers users to understand their environment, support scientific discovery, and stay informed about the waters they cherish.
