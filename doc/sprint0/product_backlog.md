### 1. As a beachgoer, I want to view current water temperatures on a mobile map so that I can decide if it's warm enough to swim.
### 2. As a fisher, I want to see water temperature trends over time so that I can predict fish activity in different locations.
### 3. As a beachgoer, I want to compare today’s temperature to the historical average so that I know if the water is unusually cold or warm.
### 4. As a fisher, I want to understand upwelling events through simple visuals so that I can better predict sudden cold snaps.
### 5. As a beachgoer, I want a simple way to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit so that I can read temperatures in my preferred unit.
### 6. As a beachgoer, I want to filter data on the map by week or month so that I can spot recent changes before visiting the beach.
### 7. As a fisher, I want to upload occasional temperature readings so that I can help build a better dataset for the fishing community.
### 8. As a citizen scientist, I want to create a user account so that I can track all my data contributions.
### 9. As a beach goer, I want an intuitive mobile-friendly map so that I can easily see temperature data for different beaches.
