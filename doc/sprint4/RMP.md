# Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect  
**Project:** GLOW by Microsofties  

---

## Meeting Details

- **When:** August 2, 2024  
- **Where:** Our House  

---

## Process – Reflection

In this sprint we reflected on how the team worked together, what worked well, and what could be improved for smoother collaboration in future iterations.

---

### Decisions that turned out well

1. **Starting the sprint earlier**  
   Beginning work ahead of schedule helped us identify blockers early and distribute workload more evenly.

2. **Aligning on priorities before starting work**  
   Defining key tasks early ensured everyone focused on high-impact features first.

3. **Meeting more regularly**  
   Frequent check-ins improved communication, allowed faster feedback, and sped up decision-making during UI/UX refinements.

---

### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. **Flexible deadlines for tasks**  
   While flexible timelines reduced stress for individuals, it caused uneven progress across features, leading to integration delays and last-minute coordination.

---

### Planned changes

1. **Set clearer deadlines and checkpoints**  
   Establish stricter internal deadlines and mid-sprint check-ins to prevent last-minute rushes.

2. **Improve estimation for unexpected work**  
   Build a small buffer into sprint planning to manage surprise tasks without affecting critical features.

## Meeting Highlights

- Continue starting early and aligning on priorities to maintain smooth progress.  
- Add time buffers for unforeseen bugs or last-minute tasks to avoid integration stress.  
- Refine CI/CD pipelines further to catch UI regressions early.  
- Next iteration will prioritize postponed features (e.g., time range filters, data export) while maintaining stability of core features.
