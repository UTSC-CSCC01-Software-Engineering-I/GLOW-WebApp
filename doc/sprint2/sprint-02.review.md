# GLOW (Team name: Microsofties)

## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sunday, July 6th, 2025
 * Where: 18 Gaslight Cres., Toronto (residence of the team members)

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- In-person Scrum meetings: Regular in-person meetings (especially at 18 Gaslight) helped resolve blockers faster and build team cohesion. This led to more productive and open sessions.
- Rotating Peer Code Reviews: Rotating reviewers ensured that everyone engaged with different parts of the codebase and prevented knowledge silos. It also improved overall code quality by exposing each piece to more eyes.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
Having flexible deadlines for everyone. This led to some work getting completed very quick and some had more delay than usual.
