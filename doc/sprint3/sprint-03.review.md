# GLOW (Team name: Microsofties)

## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sunday, July 19th, 2025
 * Where: 18 Gaslight Cres., Toronto (residence of the team members)

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

- In-person Scrum meetings: Regular in-person meetings (especially at 18 Gaslight) helped resolve blockers faster and build team cohesion. This led to more productive and open sessions.
- Rotating Peer Code Reviews: Rotating reviewers ensured that everyone engaged with different parts of the codebase and prevented knowledge silos. It also improved overall code quality by exposing each piece to more eyes.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
Having flexible deadlines for everyone. This led to some work getting completed very quick and some had more delay than usual.


#### Planned changes

*The search bar was also improved by incorporating it in the side panel. The users now get real-time feedback while searching. The users are also able to click the beaches in the sidepanel and the map zooms into the desired location.*
